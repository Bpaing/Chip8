# Chip8
Emulation attempt to test the waters.

Looking for a side project to spend time on. Chose emulation since the concepts involved in making one
were the ones I found interesting in my college courses.

Some things I learned during this project:
  CPU registers
  opcodes
  More hexadecimal and binary practice
  
Things of interest to look into
  Random Number Generator
  C++ time/chrono
  SDL Graphics
